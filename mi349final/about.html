      <p>This website is about sharing my favorite media to anyone who wishes to visit this site. To make the most out of the site, I would suggest getting familiar with the layout.</p>
      <p>
        (1) The Home page displays 2 songs, movies, and TV shows of the day. Each day of the week, 2 new songs, shows, and movies will be featured. You will be able to listen to songs and watch trailers via YouTube embedded videos (if there is no copyright privacy).
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Then there are 3 categories which you can explore more into (Music, TV, and Movies). Each of those pages will have a far more in depth selection and will be updated on a weekly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Each TV and Movie page will have ten featured items of the week, and then each week there will be 20 songs featured on the Music page. I felt as if music was better to have more of than TV and Movies because songs can be listening to quickly as opposed to the watching a movie or tv show. If you think I should have more featured items weekly, let me know!
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Finally, you are more than welcome to email me with feedback on how you feel about some of the media I post about, or if you think there is something I should post in the future. You can find my email at the bottom at any of the website pages.
      </p>
     <p>
        And always, thanks for coming to nickbunton.github.io and hope to have you here again!
