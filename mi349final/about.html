  <h2>About nickbunton.github.io</h2>

    <section>
      <p>This website is about sharing my favorite media to anyone who wishes to visit this site. To make the most out of the site, I would suggest getting familiar with the layout.</p>
      <p>
        (1) The Home page displays 2 songs, movies, and TV shows of the day. Each day of the week, 2 new songs, shows, and movies will be featured. You will be able to listen to songs and watch trailers via YouTube embedded videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Then there are 3 categories which you can explore more into (Music, TV, and Movies). Each of those pages will have a far more in depth selection and will be updated on a weekly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Finally, you are more than welcome to email me with feedback on how you feel about some of the media I post about, or if you think there is something I should post in the future. You can find my email at the bottom at any of the website pages.
      </p>
     <p>
        And always, thanks for coming to nickbunton.github.io and hope to have you here again!
